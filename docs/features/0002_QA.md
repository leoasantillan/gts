**Test Focus**: Confetti color rendering in production-like environment
- ✅ All confetti pieces display colors (not transparent/default)
- ✅ Colors include: yellow, pink, blue, green, purple, red
- ⚠️ **If confetti appears colorless, this confirms the Tailwind purging issue**

### Store Reset Issue
**Test Focus**: User data persistence during navigation
- ✅ User name appears correctly on thank you page
- ✅ Email data is available if displayed anywhere
- ⚠️ **If name/email are missing, this confirms the store reset timing issue**
