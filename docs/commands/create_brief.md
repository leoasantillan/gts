# Create Product Brief

Please create a **concise product brief** based on the description provided by the user.  
The goal is to capture both **business** and **functional requirements** and provide enough context for others working on the product.  

## Content to Include
1. **Project Overview / Description**  
   - What the product is and its purpose.  

2. **Target Audience**  
   - Who the product is for (users, customers, or stakeholders).  

3. **Primary Benefits / Features**  
   - Key value the product delivers.  
   - Core functionality that supports the value.  

4. **High-Level Tech / Architecture**  
   - Technologies, frameworks, or systems involved.  
   - Keep this at a high level (donâ€™t go into implementation details).

## Guidelines
- Keep the brief **very concise** and **to the point**.  
- Provide just enough context to understand the bigger picture.  
- Use bullet points where possible for clarity.

## Output
- Write the document into `docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` (unless another filename is specified).
