# Quick Code Review

Do a quick code review of the implementation against the attached plan.  

## Focus Areas
- **Plan Compliance**: Check if requirements are fully implemented; flag anything missing or incorrect.  
- **Bugs & Logic**: Identify obvious errors or risky assumptions.  
- **Data Alignment**: Look for mismatches (e.g., snake_case vs camelCase, `{ data: {} }` vs flat objects).  
- **Maintainability**: Flag over-engineering or overly large files.  
- **Consistency & Style**: Spot syntax or naming patterns that donâ€™t match the rest of the codebase.  

## Output
- Keep feedback concise and actionable.
